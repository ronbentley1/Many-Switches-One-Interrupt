# Many-Switches-One-Interrup

## Summary
An Arduino sketch that shows how we are able to use many switches of different types, wired in different schemes to a single interrupt service routine (ISR).

The supplied example sketch is configured for six switches - three x toggle and three x button.

The method is fully software driven and does not require any physical connections to the digital pin allocated to the ISR.

The features used by the sketch arise from the ez_switch_lib library.

See the circuits diagram for the wiring scheme and the Arduino project hub:
